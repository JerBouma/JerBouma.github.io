This is proven by my achievements within the Finance domain by working as an ALM Advisor at PGGM, one of the largest pension funds in the Netherlands, and working as a Product Manager for OpenBB, a fintech start-up democratising access to investment research.

This education not only discusses much of the relevant theory but also gives many examples of how these theories are currently applied within a multitude of different investment organisations.

Furthermore, throughout the last several years I’ve spent thousands of hours developing in Python in the areas of quantitative and statistical modelling, and data science. Find all of my currently active open-source projects inside the <a href="/projects">projects page</a> which include the Finance Database and Financial Toolkit with both well over 1.000 GitHub Stars as well as the OpenBB Terminal in which I am one of the leading contributors with major contributions in the area of fundamental analysis, economics, fixed income and econometrics.

All of this comes together within my current role as Financial Risk Analyst at A.S.R, one of the largest insurance companies in the Netherlands. Within this role, I am responsible for much of the financial modelling related to the investment strategy and will manage models that keep the balance sheets of A.S.R. in check. In doing so, I work closely with a range of (equity) analysts and have biweekly analysts calls to discuss market conditions.

**[Minh Hoang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/minhhoang95/) - Product Manager at OpenBB**

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="eighty-column-left">
*I highly recommend Jeroen as an asset in any organization. Jeroen led and executed OpenBB's go-to-market initiatives, including Academia, with exceptional skill. It is not easy to find Jeroen's combination of solid finance knowledge and Programming knowledge. On top of that, he consistently demonstrates a strong work ethic and a drive to achieve outstanding results.*

**[Sri Chilukuri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srichilukuri/) - Vice President of Product Marketing at OpenBB**

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="eighty-column-left">
*Jeroen has been a delight to work with. With his expertise in investment research and “can do” attitude, he quickly transformed himself into an excellent product marketing manager at OpenBB. In fact, I would not hesitate to say that he was often the lone sane voice in helping steer the heavily engineering-centric company in the right business direction. His leadership of the highly successful OpenBB Terminal 2.0 launch event in November 2022 and the company's ongoing go-to-market (GTM) push into Academia are testaments to his newly acquired product marketing skills as well as his overall professionalism. Jeroen has my highest recommendation and I look forward to working with him again in the future.*

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="eighty-column-left">
*Jeroen joined our team just at the right time. As we were considering a full redevelopment of our ALM model, Jeroen's knowledge of Python first greatly helped us in the decision process. In the implementation phase Jeroen played a key role on the development of the technical side of the model. Meanwhile he did a good job at educating our team on these new topics and providing good documentation. Working together with Jeroen was a pleasure. First of all he's a nice guy, Furthermore he provided an alternative way of thinking and working that was new for us and helped us innovate and work more efficiently. Over time I learned a lot from Jeroen which I'm very thankful for!*
