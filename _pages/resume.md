I am strongly analytical, have a keen sense of long-term investment strategy and have a “can do” attitude. This is proven by my achievements within the Finance domain by working as an ALM Advisor at PGGM, one of the largest pension funds in the Netherlands, and working as a Product Manager for OpenBB, a fintech start-up democratising access to investment research. Furthermore, I have a strong educational background in Finance, CFA level 1 and the post-master education titled Registered Financial Analyst (VBA/RBA) completed. This education not only discusses much of the relevant theory but also gives many examples of how these theories are currently applied within a multitude of different investment organisations.

Furthermore, throughout the last several years I’ve spent thousands of hours developing in Python in the areas of quantitative and statistical modelling, and data science. Find all of my currently active open-source projects inside the <a href="/projects">projects page</a> which include the Finance Database and Financial Toolkit with both well over 1.000 GitHub Stars as well as the OpenBB Terminal in which I am one of the leading contributors with major contributions in the area of fundamental analysis, economics, fixed income and econometrics.

All of this comes together within my current role as Financial Risk Analyst at A.S.R, one of the largest insurance companies in the Netherlands. Within this role, I am responsible for much of the financial modelling related to the investment strategy and will manage models that keep the balance sheets of A.S.R. in check. In doing so, I work closely with a range of (equity) analysts and have biweekly analysts calls to discuss market conditions.

    <div class="tooltip">
        <b>MS Excel</b> is the bread and butter for most financial analysis and is strongly embeded in my work and personal projects both through analysis and as data storage. A great example is the Finance Database that relies on compressed CSVs to store data and allow for easy adjustments where needed.

    <div class="tooltip">
        <b>Python</b> is my main programming language which I have invested thousands of hours in by now. I have used it for a wide range of applications ranging from actuarial models, financial analysis, data science, web development, machine learning and much more.

        Both in college and during my time at PGGM, <b>MATLAB</b> was used. I've learned how to read and write code as PGGM was expanding its ALM model and later on transition it to Python. This allowed me to really understand the language and understand the advantages it has over other languages.

**[Didier Lopes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/didier-lopes/) - CEO at OpenBB**

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="eighty-column-left">
*On the 13th of October 2021, I recieved an email from Jeroen about adding one of his finance GitHub packages to the OpenBB Terminal (then Gamestonk Terminal). After digging into his open source projects and his achievements I was very impressed. When we had a chat regarding how to work together, I offered him a job on the spot. Jeroen was at the intersection of finance, programming and open source - which is a combination that is very hard to find - even today (almost 2 years later).*

*Jeroen ended up joining us a few months after that inital meeting. He started in the role of Product Manager where he helped drive the direction of the OpenBB Terminal, not only from a product perspective but also joining the development team. Menus such as economy, portfolio, econometrics, fixed income are Jeroen’s legacy and they wouldn’t have the quality they have today without Jeroen’s financial theory knowledge - ultimately, the team saw Jeroen as the go-to person when financial theory was involved.*

*More recently, Jeroen shifted to the role of Product Marketing Manager so that he could focus on the go-to market and showing users (through documentation, webinars, videos) how they could use OpenBB products for real use cases. In addition, he led OpenBB’s academia motion, and created presentations such as “The Greek Government Debt Crisis”, “Performing Financial Due Diligence” and “The Influence of the Central Bank” which used OpenBB for research and were presented at different universities in the UK and Netherlands.*

*Apart from his financial expertise, I always admired Jeroen’s work ethic and organization skills. As a startup founder, you want people on your team that get shit done, and Jeroen was one of those people. I never had to worry with a task not being done, or being done late. If anything, he always went above and beyond. I highly recommend Jeroen.*

**[Minh Hoang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/minhhoang95/) - Product Manager at OpenBB**

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="eighty-column-left">
*I highly recommend Jeroen as an asset in any organization. Jeroen led and executed OpenBB's go-to-market initiatives, including Academia, with exceptional skill. It is not easy to find Jeroen's combination of solid finance knowledge and Programming knowledge. On top of that, he consistently demonstrates a strong work ethic and a drive to achieve outstanding results.*

**[Sri Chilukuri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srichilukuri/) - Vice President of Product Marketing at OpenBB**

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="eighty-column-left">
*Jeroen has been a delight to work with. With his expertise in investment research and “can do” attitude, he quickly transformed himself into an excellent product marketing manager at OpenBB. In fact, I would not hesitate to say that he was often the lone sane voice in helping steer the heavily engineering-centric company in the right business direction. His leadership of the highly successful OpenBB Terminal 2.0 launch event in November 2022 and the company's ongoing go-to-market (GTM) push into Academia are testaments to his newly acquired product marketing skills as well as his overall professionalism. Jeroen has my highest recommendation and I look forward to working with him again in the future.*

**[Luuk van Benthem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luuk-van-benthem-b817a765/) - Senior ALM Adviseur at PGGM**

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="eighty-column-left">
*Jeroen joined our team just at the right time. As we were considering a full redevelopment of our ALM model, Jeroen's knowledge of Python first greatly helped us in the decision process. In the implementation phase Jeroen played a key role on the development of the technical side of the model. Meanwhile he did a good job at educating our team on these new topics and providing good documentation. Working together with Jeroen was a pleasure. First of all he's a nice guy, Furthermore he provided an alternative way of thinking and working that was new for us and helped us innovate and work more efficiently. Over time I learned a lot from Jeroen which I'm very thankful for!*

*(Written in Dutch) Jeroen is zeer bedreven in alle facetten van programmeren in Python. Zijn kennis en ervaring op het gebied van Python hebben een grote meerwaarde geleverd voor mijn afdeling. Jeroen is scherp als het aankomt op het juist implementeren van code in Python. Daarnaast is hij ook bedreven in het draaiend krijgen en houden van Python op werkplekken en de ondersteuning die hierbij nodig is. Hij is gedreven om altijd verbeteringen aan te brengen en handmatige processen te automatiseren.
