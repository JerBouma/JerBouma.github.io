My name is Jeroen Bouma and I work as a Financial Risk Analyst at [A.S.R.](https://www.asrnl.com/){:target="_blank"} which is one of the largest Dutch insurance companies with over €60 billion assets under management (AUM). Within this role I am responsible for analysing the profitability and investment risks, perform sensitivity analysis on both assets and liabilities and develop new and existing financial models to better understand the relationship between risk and return working closely with a variety of financial analysts.

I've ended up at A.S.R. after having worked at [OpenBB](https://openbb.co/){:target="_blank"}, an open-source company revolutionizing the way investment research is done and [PGGM](https://www.pggm.nl/en/){:target="_blank"}, one of the largest pension funds in the Netherlands with well over €300 billion AUM.  All three have one thing in common which characterises myself as well: combining (advanced) Python modelling with Quantitative Finance.

When I first laid my hands on Python back in University I instantly felt like this an amazing tool with many uses in the financial world and that's exactly why I've spend thousands of hours programming in this language whether it is related to internal models like at A.S.R. and PGGM or right in the open through open-source (as also can be seen on my [projects](/projects) page). As I've seen many models and calculations being repeated internally several times within financial firms, I am a big advocate for open-source in which individuals and firms no longer need to rely on proprietary models.

In terms of (Quantitative) Finance, I enjoy working in the intersection between advanced financial modelling and making (qualitative) sense of the market and where it is heading. The financial world is controlled mostly by the behaviour of humans, history has shown time after time that we are not rational at all and are much more controller by emotions than we realise. Next to that, it is (nearly) impossible to predict the future. Whatever investment approach you are applying, it can only be based on current and past observations. This leaves plenty of room for discussion between the assumptions and therefore the input for econometric models as well as how to interpret the output of the model. This intersection is what I enjoy the most which has been the recurring theme in both my time at university and my professional career.

On this website, you are able to find a detailed resume including testiominals, my Python projects related to financial theory, all talks and videos that I've been a part of and lastly a complete list of literature that I've read to better understand the financial world.
