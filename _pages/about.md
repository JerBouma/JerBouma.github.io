excerpt: My name is Jeroen Bouma and I work as a Financial Risk Analyst at ASR which is one of the largest Dutch insurance companies with over €60 billion assets under management (AUM). Within this role I am responsible for analysing the profitability and investment risks and develop new and existing financial models. As I've seen many models and calculations being repeated internally several times within financial firms, I am a big advocate for open-source in which individuals and firms no longer need to rely on proprietary models.

My name is Jeroen Bouma and I work as a Financial Risk Analyst at [A.S.R.](https://www.asrnl.com/){:target="_blank"} which is one of the largest Dutch insurance companies with over €60 billion assets under management (AUM). Within this role I am responsible for analysing the profitability and investment risks, perform sensitivity analysis on both assets and liabilities and develop new and existing financial models to better understand the relationship between risk and return working closely with a variety of financial analysts.

I've ended up at A.S.R. after having worked at [OpenBB](https://openbb.co/){:target="_blank"}, an open-source company revolutionizing the way investment research is done and [PGGM](https://www.pggm.nl/en/){:target="_blank"}, one of the largest pension funds in the Netherlands with well over €300 billion AUM.  All three have one thing in common which characterises myself as well: combining (advanced) Python modelling with Quantitative Finance.

On this website, you are able to find a detailed resume including testimonials, my Python projects related to financial theory, all talks and videos that I’ve been a part of and lastly a complete list of literature that I’ve read to better understand the financial world.

**Sri Chulukuri - Vice President of Product Marketing at OpenBB**

*Jeroen has been a delight to work with. With his expertise in investment research and “can do” attitude, he quickly transformed himself into an excellent product marketing manager at OpenBB. In fact, I would not hesitate to say that he was often the lone sane voice in helping steer the heavily engineering-centric company in the right business direction. Jeroen has my highest recommendation and I look forward to working with him again in the future.*

**Luuk van Benthem - Senior ALM Adviseur at PGGM**

*Jeroen joined our team just at the right time. As we were considering a full redevelopment of our ALM model, Jeroen's knowledge of Python first greatly helped us in the decision process. In the implementation phase Jeroen played a key role on the development of the technical side of the model. Working together with Jeroen was a pleasure. First of all he's a nice guy, Furthermore he provided an alternative way of thinking and working that was new for us and helped us innovate and work more efficiently. Over time I learned a lot from Jeroen which I'm very thankful for!*

(Written in Dutch) *Jeroen is zeer bedreven in alle facetten van programmeren in Python. Zijn kennis en ervaring op het gebied van Python hebben een grote meerwaarde geleverd voor mijn afdeling. Jeroen is scherp als het aankomt op het juist implementeren van code in Python. Jeroen werkt zeer gestructureerd en is met een positieve insteek bezig met zijn eigen ontwikkeling en hoe hij zelf beter kan worden in het vakgebied. Al met al een fijne collega!*
