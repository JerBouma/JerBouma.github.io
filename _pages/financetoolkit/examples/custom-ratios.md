title: Custom Ratios in the Finance Toolkit
permalink: /projects/financetoolkit/custom-ratios
excerpt: The Finance Toolkit has an abundance of financial ratios, however it could be that you are looking for a specific ratio that is currently not provided. First and foremost, I encourage you to create a Pull Request to add these ratios in but there is also an option to add custom ratios as follows. This feature was designed by sword134.
