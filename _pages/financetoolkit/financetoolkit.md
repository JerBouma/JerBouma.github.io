title: Finance Toolkit
excerpt: This is an open-source toolkit in which all relevant financial ratios (50+), indicators and performance measurements are written down in the most simplistic way allowing for complete transparency of the calculation method. This allows you to not have to rely on metrics from other providers and, given a financial statement, allow for efficient manual calculations. This leads to one uniform method of calculation being applied that is available and understood by everyone.

While browsing a variety of websites, I kept finding that the same financial metric can greatly vary per source and so do the financial statements reported while little information is given how the metric was calculated.

For example, Microsoft's Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio on the 6th of May, 2023 is reported to be 28.93 (Stockopedia), 32.05 (Morningstar), 32.66 (Macrotrends), 33.09 (Finance Charts), 33.66 (Y Charts), 33.67 (Wall Street Journal), 33.80 (Yahoo Finance) and 34.4 (Companies Market Cap). All of these calculations are correct, however the method applied varies leading to different results. Therefore, collecting data from multiple sources can lead to wrong interpretation of the results given that one source could be applying a different calculation method than another. And that is, if it is even freely available. Often the calculation is hidden behind a paid subscription.

**This is why I designed the FinanceToolkit**, this is an open-source toolkit in which all relevant financial ratios (50+), indicators and performance measurements are written down in the most simplistic way allowing for complete transparency of the calculation method. This allows you to not have to rely on metrics from other providers and, given a financial statement, allow for efficient manual calculations. This leads to one uniform method of calculation being applied that is available and understood by everyone.

The Finance Toolkit is complimented very well with the [Finance Database ðŸŒŽ](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase), a database that features 300.000+ symbols containing Equities, ETFs, Funds, Indices, Currencies, Cryptocurrencies and Money Markets. By utilising both, it is possible to do a fully-fledged competitive analysis with the tickers found from the FinanceDatabase inputted into the FinanceToolkit.

## Installation

To install the FinanceToolkit it simply requires the following:

```
pip install financetoolkit
````

Then within Python use:

```python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit
```
To be able to get started, you need to obtain an API Key from FinancialModelingPrep. This is used to gain access to 30+ years of financial statement both annually and quarterly. Note that the Free plan is limited to 250 requests each day, 5 years of data and only features companies listed on US exchanges.

Through the link you are able to subscribe for the free plan and also premium plans at a **15% discount**. This is an affiliate link and thus supports the project at the same time I have chosen FinancialModelingPrep as a source as I find it to be the most transparent, reliable and at an affordable price. I have yet to find a platform offering such low prices for the amount of data offered. When you notice that the data is inaccurate or have any other issue related to the data, note that I simply provide the means to access this data and I am not responsible for the accuracy of the data itself. For this, use [their contact form](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/contact) or provide the data yourself. 

## Using the Finance Toolkit

A basic example of how to initialise the Finance Toolkit is shown below, also see [this notebook](/projects/financetoolkit/getting-started) for a detailed Getting Started guide as well as [this notebook](/projects/financetoolkit/finance-database) that includes the [Finance Database ðŸŒŽ](/projects/financedatabase) and a proper financial analysis.

````python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

companies = Toolkit(['AAPL', 'MSFT'], api_key="FMP_KEY", start_date='2017-12-31')

# an Enterprise example
enterprise = companies.get_enterprise()

# a Historical example
historical_data = companies.get_historical_data()

# a Financial Statement example
balance_sheet_statement = companies.get_balance_sheet_statement()

# a Ratios example
profitability_ratios = companies.ratios.collect_profitability_ratios()

# Show the profitability ratios for Apple
profitability_ratios.loc['AAPL']
````

This returns the following output for `profitability_ratios.loc['AAPL]`. Omitting `.loc['AAPL']` will return the result for both AAPL and MSFT.

### Defining Custom Ratios

The Finance Toolkit has an abundance of financial ratios, however it could be that you are looking for a specific ratio that is currently not provided. First and foremost, I encourage you to [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceToolkit/pulls) to add these ratios in but there is also an option to add custom ratios as follows. This feature was designed by [sword134](https://github.com/sword134).
