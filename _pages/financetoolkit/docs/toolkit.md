title: Toolkit
excerpt: I am strongly analytical, have a keen sense of long-term investment strategy and have a “can do” attitude. This is proven by my achievements within the Finance domain by working as an ALM Advisor at PGGM, one of the largest pension funds in the Netherlands, and working as a Product Manager for OpenBB, a fintech start-up democratising access to investment research. Furthermore, I have a strong educational background in Finance, CFA level 1 and the post-master education titled Registered Financial Analyst (VBA/RBA) completed. This education not only discusses much of the relevant theory but also gives many examples of how these theories are currently applied within a multitude of different investment organisations.
