excerpt: Much of the Finance theory I have learned, I apply within Python which I have spend thousands of hours developing in. This is in the fields of Data Science & Machine Learning, Fundamental, Algorithmic and Technical Analysis, GUIs and web-based dashboards as well as various other topics. On this page you are able to find all major Python projects I am actively maintaining.

When I discovered Python during my time in University, I was immediately captivated by its incredible versatility in the financial domain. Since then, I have devoted countless hours to programming in this language, whether it's developing internal models for companies like A.S.R. and PGGM or contributing to open-source projects (as demonstrated on this page). Witnessing the repetition of models and calculations within financial institutions has made me a strong advocate for open-source, as it liberates individuals and firms from relying solely on proprietary models.

## Finance Database

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="sixty-column mobile-max-column-width">
This database features 300.000+ symbols containing Equities, ETFs, Funds, Indices, Currencies, Cryptocurrencies and Money Markets. It therefore allows you to obtain a broad overview of sectors, industries, types of investments and much more.

The aim of this database is explicitly not to provide up-to-date fundamentals or stock data as those can be obtained with ease (with the help of this database) by using yfinance or FundamentalAnalysis. Instead, it gives insights into the products that exist in each country, industry and sector and gives the most essential information about each product. With this information, you can analyse specific areas of the financial world and/or find a product that is hard to find.

## Fundamental Analysis

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="sixty-column mobile-max-column-width">
This package collects fundamentals and detailed company stock data from a large group of companies (20.000+) from FinancialModelingPrep and uses Yahoo Finance to obtain stock data for any financial instrument. It allows the user to do most of the essential fundamental analysis. It also gives the possibility to quickly compare multiple companies or do a sector analysis.

To find symbols of specific sectors and/or industries have a look at my Finance Database, a database that features 300.000+ symbols containing Equities, ETFs, Funds, Indices, Currencies, Cryptocurrencies and Money Markets

## The Passive Investor

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="sixty-column mobile-max-column-width">
With a large increase in ETFs available, it can become difficult to make the best choice in what you wish to invest. There are many different providers (iShares, Vanguard, Invesco) as well as with changes to the underlying stocks (i.e. High Yield, Super Dividends, Equal Weighted).

This is quickly reflected when looking for a S&P 500 ETF as there are over 20 different ETFs available. With this package, I wish to make investment decisions easier to make and manage.
