title: Perform a Dupont Analysis on Railroad Companies
permalink: /projects/financedatabase/dupont-analysis
excerpt: A great use-case for the data found in the Finance Database is to do competitive analysis in which companies are compared that compete for the same market. For example, in case I want to look into the Railroad companies in the United States that are marked as "Large Cap", I can directly search for this with the Finance Database and use the Finance Toolkit to do further research. This Notebook shows how to do that.
