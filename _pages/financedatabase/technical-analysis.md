title: Technical Analysis of Biotech ETFs
permalink: /projects/financedatabase/technical-analysis
excerpt: The Finance Database is a great way to find specific ETFs that are hard to find. For example, if you want to find all Biotech ETFs, you can do so with the Finance Database. With that information, it is then possible to do a technical analysis using the Finance Toolkit to get insights, in this case, of how these ETFs moved during the early stages of the Coronacrisis. This Notebook shows how to acquire these ETFs and how to perform a technical analysis on the ETFs.
