I am always excited to engage in conversations about financial theory, explore new Python-based financial projects, or delve into general discussions surrounding finance. If you share a passion for these topics and would like to show your support for my projects and work, I would be grateful if you considered [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/JerBouma). Your support goes a long way in fueling my dedication to these endeavors but constructive feedback is just as helpful!

You can reach out to me for:

1. Questions regarding any of my open-source projects such as the Finance Toolkit or the Finance Database.
2. Requests to work together or collaborate on a project, event or other initiatives.
3. General discussions about the financial industry or Python programming.
