On this page, you will find a collection of my experiences and contributions within the finance and technology sectors. I had the privilege of serving as a jury member in the Utrecht University's Finance Hackathon, where students were challenged to create a Robo Advisor using Python. Additionally, I delivered presentations at universities, introducing the OpenBB Terminal and highlighting the role of Python in the financial industry. These experiences reflect my commitment to sharing knowledge and insights within the finance and technology domains, making this page a valuable resource for those interested in these fields. **Interested in partnering with me?

## Jury Member of the Utrecht University's Finance Hackathon

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="fifty-column-left mobile-max-column-width">
I have participated in the Utrecht University's Finance Hackathon as a jury member. The 100+ Finance students had the entire day to come up with Robo Advisor by using Python based on a large dataset of investment instruments. The challenge of this assignment was finding the right balance between quantitative analysis, thinking about the investor's profile and applying proven investment theory which meant maximizing for Sharpe Ratio was not at all efficient.

Throughout this day I've coached several teams in how to apply financial theory within Python and what made sense given the dataset. It was very interesting to see the different approaches students made from applying portfolio optimization to cherry picking just a few assets. All in all, a great event and I'm looking forward to the next one!

## Revolutionizing The Way Investment Research Is Done

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="fifty-column-left mobile-max-column-width">
I gave two presentations at the University of Loughborough and for the University of Warwick. It was very rewarding to see the amount of interest from students as both sessions had well over 100 students present.

These presentations were meant to enlighten students about the OpenBB Terminal and what OpenBB wants to achieve in the near future. This recording was done at the University of Warwick in collaboration with the Warwick Finance Society.

## Role of Python in the Financial Industry 

<div class="row">
<div markdown="1" class="fifty-column-left mobile-max-column-width">
I got approached by Utrecht University whether I'd be interested in providing a guest lecture to Finance students taking a workshop on Python. Being an alumni myself and enthusiastic about Python, I couldn't let this opportunity pass to return back to my former University.

Therefore, I did four presentations for nearly a hundred Master students at the campus. My goal with these presentations was to enlighten the students to take Python seriously for their careers within the financial sector, explaining the practical application with personal experience.

## Introduction to the OpenBB Terminal

<div markdown="1" class="fifty-column-left mobile-max-column-width">
As part of my initative to present OpenBB to students and professors, I've been introducing the OpenBB Terminal to the students at Athens University in which I go over the structure, the basics and two use-cases.

The goal was to give a clear overview of some of the capabilities of the OpenBB Terminal and explain to the students how they can use the OpenBB Terminal for their market and investment reports.
